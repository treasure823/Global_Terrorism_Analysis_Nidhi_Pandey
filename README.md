# Abstract
Terrorism has been a major threat to people’s lives for centuries. This has recently emerged to be one of the most powerful and violent acts to suppress the free will of any thinking entity by means of intimidation. Judging global peace by just the number of attacks can often be one-dimensional and would potentially lead one to massively underestimate an imminent threat. As the well-known adage goes, it’s the punch you don’t see coming that knocks you out. Hence, there is an inherent need to study the past in order to avoid repeating it.

In this project, we will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Database collected by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). 

# 1. Problem Statement
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. 
The objectives of the projects are:
a)	To import the necessary modules and datasets.
b)	To perform data wrangling on the datasets to perform Data Analysis successfully 
c)	To obtain useful insights from the dataset through Data Exploration and Visualization techniques.

# 2. Introduction
The Global Terrorism Database has provided a vast record of terror attacks with diverse list of specifications for each record. In order to prevent the data’s own details obscuring it, this project views the subject of the matter through four lenses:
●	Organization
●	 Regional & Global Trends
●	 Type of Attack
●	 Target Type

The main factors chosen to determine the magnitude of the attack are the number of fatalities and number of wounded victims.
Insights from the data were obtained using data visualisations like bar plot, pie plot, strip plot, scatter plot and line plot.

The GTD is an open-source database, which provides information on domestic and international terrorist attacks around the world since 1970 through 2017 and now includes more than 180,000 events. For each event, a wide range of information is available, including the date and location of the incident, the weapons used, nature of the target, the number of casualties, and – when identifiable – the group or individual responsible. The data is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
The project aims to gain insights about terror attacks collectively in different regions through time, find out the regions that are hit the most and check to see how terrorism in itself is diverse with its targets and means.
Due to the large quantity of the data and its diversity, the analysis and visualizations are performed only after doing preliminary processes including Handling Null Values, Finding Correlations and summarizing the data’s central tendency, dispersion and shape of data distribution in order to get rudimentary insights. 
For Exploratory Data Analysis, we are viewing the data through 4 lenses: Terrorist Organization, Global & Regional trends of Attack, Type of Attack and Target Type. The main criteria used to measure the magnitude of the attack is the number of fatalities. The project made use of the Correlation Heatmaps initially as a guide to explore relations between Attack Types and Weapon Types.
The project made use of different plots including line plots, bar plots, pie plots, joint plots, strip plot and scatter plots to visualize the data. As more findings were presented, more questions arose. This never-ending loop helped arrive to the following conclusions:

# We got to know about most affected target types are
	Private Citizens and property
	Police
	Military

# Analysis of the types of attacks and number of causalities
	Bombing/Explosion (more than twice as frequent than Armed Assault)
	Armed Assault (twice as frequent than Assassinations)
	Assassination - More than 80000 causalities have been happened due to these attacks

# Analysis of Top organization with large attacks
	Taliban
	2)Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant
	3)shining Path (SL)
The Civil War between Iraq and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has claimed 1570 fatalities, the largest taken in any terror attack

# Most Notorious Terror Organisations
	Taliban
	Boko Haram
	Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)
	Shining Path (SL)
These organisations alone have contributed to more than one third of the total fatalities and almost 50% of the total attacks

# Common Attacks Perpetrated on different Targets
	Assassination
	Bombing/Explosion
	Facilities and infrastructure attack
Assassination is the most common type attack perpetrated on Government officials and Media Journalists. Bombings are frequently used to thwart Businesses and Religious Figures/Institutions.

# Visualizing the extent of the commonly perpetrated attacks in different regions of the country
	Armed Assault is a dominant type of attack in regions like
	Central America & Caribbean
	Sub-Saharan Africa and
	North America

# Bombings/Explosion is a dominant type of attack in regions like
	Middle East & North Africa
	South Asia and
	Eastern Europe

# Analysis of Global terrorist attack trend
From the above chart we can see the growth in global terrorism trend since 1970 it grown in between those years as we observe through the chart. And it is at its peaks after 2010 and Global Terrorism started increasing to an all-time high from 2011. This peaked in the year 2014 and started dipping ever since.

# Analysis of the number of fatalities
From the chart more than 8000 people were wounded during these attacks. Most of it happens because of "Bombing/Explosion".

# Correlation/Heatmap
	We observe positive correlation between weapons and types of attacks
	Use of Explosives and Bombings/Explosions (0.91)
	Use of Firearms and Armed Assault (0.68)
	Use of Incendiary and Facility/Infrastructure Attack (0.71)
